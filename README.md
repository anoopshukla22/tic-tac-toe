# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game typically played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players who take turns marking spaces in the grid with their respective symbols, usually X and O, with the goal of getting three of their own symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
